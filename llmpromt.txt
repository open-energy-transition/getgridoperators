#VERSION I

You are building a high precision national electricity ecosystem dataset.

For EACH country provided, identify the PRIMARY national-level institutions across the full electricity ecosystem.

CRITICAL RULES:

Governance-aware listing:

If the country is centralized: return ONLY the single primary institution per category.

If the country legally designates multiple national operators (multi-TSO or ISO/RTO model), list ALL primary entities but cap at 6 per category.

Do NOT include provincial, municipal, or subnational bodies.

Do NOT include NGOs or associations inside governance categories.

Language rules:

Use the official local-language name as the main name.

If an official English version is widely used, include it in the also_known_as column.

Preserve correct spelling and diacritics.

Filtering:

Only national-level institutions.

Avoid minor organizations.

If unsure, include but set confidence to MED or LOW.

OUTPUT FORMAT OVERRIDE (MANDATORY)

Do NOT output raw CSV.

Do NOT output markdown code blocks.

Output must be a clean readable table.

Use a simple pipe-delimited table format.

Include a header row.

Keep one row per line.

No blank lines inside the table.

No explanations.

No commentary.

No wrapping text.

All fields must remain single-line.

Preserve exact schema column order.

Schema order must be:

country_label | primary_language | category | name_local | name_english | official_website | confidence | statutory_role | notes

The table must be directly copy-pasteable into Excel or Google Sheets.

DUPLICATION CONTROL (critical):
- Do NOT repeat the same institution multiple times within a country unless it truly plays distinct statutory roles.
- If the same institution legitimately appears in multiple categories (e.g., AEMO as both TSO and MarketOperator), keep it, but:
  - Use the same exact spelling in the name field across categories.
  - In comment, explicitly state: "Same institution as <other category>; retained due to distinct role."
- If two categories would otherwise contain the same institution but the role is not truly distinct, keep it only in the most appropriate category and leave the other category with no row.
- Never output duplicate rows with identical (country_label, category, name).


OUTPUT DELIVERY INSTRUCTION (MANDATORY)

You must generate a CSV FILE as the final output.

Do NOT display the table in the UI.
Do NOT render the CSV inline as formatted text.
Do NOT provide explanations.
Do NOT include markdown.
Do NOT include code blocks.

The CSV file must:

Be properly formatted (UTF-8 encoding).

Use comma separators.

Contain exactly the required columns in the correct order.

Be fully populated with one row per institution.

Be downloadable as a file.

File name format:
national_electricity_ecosystem_<date>.csv

If file generation is not possible, return raw CSV only (no commentary, no markdown, no explanations).

Return only a generated CSV file. No UI rendering. No explanations. No markdown.

PROMPT FOR CROSSREFERENCING ENERGY INSTITUTIONS WITH ENERGY MODELS USED

#######################################################



You are an expert energy-sector researcher focused on energy system modelling tools, power system simulation, market modelling, and planning tools used by energy institutions.

I will provide a CSV (or pasted rows) with a header that defines the BASE SCHEMA.

TASK
For each input row (institution), identify energy modelling tools / software / frameworks that the institution uses or explicitly references using, and capture evidence for each claim. Output an expanded dataset.

KEY OUTPUT DESIGN (LONG FORMAT)

* Output is one row per institution–tool pair.
* Preserve the BASE SCHEMA exactly as provided (same column names, same order, unchanged).
* Append the NEW COLUMNS listed below after the base columns.
* If an institution has multiple tools/frameworks, output multiple rows duplicating the base fields.
* If no tools are found with valid evidence, output exactly one row with tool_name = "UNKNOWN".

SCOPE (what counts as tools/software, can be open source too)
Include tools used for:

* planning/expansion and adequacy
* unit commitment / dispatch / production cost modelling
* market simulation / bidding / settlement simulation
* forecasting when used operationally or for planning inputs
* modelling data platforms when explicitly used for modelling/planning
* in-house tools only if explicitly named


DE-PRIORITIZE (do not focus on these)

* dynamic/EMTP and detailed transient tools, unless the institution explicitly highlights them in a planning/market context or they are the only available evidence

HARD FILTERS

* Do NOT guess. Do NOT infer tools based on peers or typical practice.
* Use a wide search: you may consider ANY modelling tool you find (commercial, open-source, in-house).
* Prefer primary official sources: institution websites, official reports/methodologies, procurement/tenders, regulator filings, operator procedures, job postings, official presentations, official repositories.
* Avoid blogs, vendor marketing pages, or third-party summaries unless nothing else exists (then set evidence_strength=LOW and explain why).

EVIDENCE STANDARD (MANDATORY, PER TOOL)
For every tool you list, provide at least one evidence item with:

* source_type: {official_report, official_methodology, tender_procurement, job_posting, presentation, repository, peer_reviewed, news_release, other}
* source_title
* source_date (YYYY-MM-DD if available; otherwise blank)
* source_link (URL if retrievable; otherwise blank)
* exact_snippet_or_quote: <= 25 words (or a very tight paraphrase if quoting is not possible)
* why_it_supports_the_claim: 1 sentence

LINK VALIDITY GATE (CRITICAL)

* You may ONLY use a source_link if it is retrievable (opens successfully; not 404/blocked; contains the report/file/data available; it is not "unknown").
* If a candidate link is not retrievable, do NOT cite it; find an alternative working source_link.
* If you cannot find any working evidence link for a tool, do NOT list that tool unless evidence_strength=LOW, source_link is blank, and notes state: "No retrievable source link found".
* If no tools have retrievable evidence for an institution, output exactly one row with tool_name="UNKNOWN" and notes describing what source types were checked.

CONTROLLED VALUES

* evidence_strength: HIGH, MED, LOW
* tool_category: planning_expansion, production_cost_uc, market_simulation, distribution_planning, forecasting, data_platform, other

DE-DUPLICATION
Avoid duplicates for the same institution + tool_name + use_case. Prefer the strongest retrievable source. If additional retrievable sources exist, note: "additional sources exist".

OUTPUT FORMAT OVERRIDE (MANDATORY)

* Output must be a clean pipe-delimited table or a CSV, not a markdown code block.
* Include a header row.
* One row per line.
* No blank lines.
* All fields must remain single-line.

NEW COLUMNS TO APPEND (in this exact order)
tool_name | tool_category | use_case | evidence_strength | source_type | source_title | source_date | source_link | exact_snippet_or_quote | why_it_supports_the_claim | comments

INPUT I WILL PROVIDE
I will paste:

1. The BASE SCHEMA header row, then
2. The data rows (or upload a CSV).

Proceed immediately after receiving them.
