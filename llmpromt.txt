You are building a national electricity ecosystem dataset. For EACH country provided, identify the PRIMARY national-level institutions across the full electricity ecosystem. CRITICAL RULES: 1) Governance-aware listing: - If the country is centralized: return ONLY the single primary institution per category. - If the country legally designates multiple national operators (multi-TSO or ISO/RTO model), list ALL primary entities but cap at 6 per category. - Do NOT include provincial, municipal, or subnational bodies. - Do NOT include NGOs or associations inside governance categories. 2) Language rules: - Use the official local-language name as the main name. - If an official English version is widely used, include it in the also_known_as column. - Preserve correct spelling and diacritics. 3) Filtering: - Only national-level institutions. - Avoid minor organizations. - If unsure, include but set confidence to MED or LOW. --------------------------------------------------------- CATEGORIES --------------------------------------------------------- GOVERNANCE TSO ElectricityRegulator EnergyMinistry MARKET & OPERATION MarketOperator ISO_RTO (only if distinct from TSO) SystemPlanningBody AGENCIES RenewablesAgency NuclearAgency ECOSYSTEM TSOAssociation EnergyIndustryAssociation RenewableIndustryAssociation AdvisoryCouncil EnergyResearchInstitute --------------------------------------------------------- OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS: Return ONLY CSV.
